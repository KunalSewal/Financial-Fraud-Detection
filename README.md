# Financial-Fraud-Detection
Project focuses on applying recent Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) and their variants to detect fraudulent transactions in financial networks. By modeling how transactions evolve over time and across multiple entity types, we aim to capture subtle fraud patterns that static or older temporal methods may overlook.
